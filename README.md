# Palworld Local Save
This is a small script to save local Palworld world files to GitHub. This utilizes my old [Valheim World Sync](https://github.com/jonathanlo411/valheim-world-sync) as a base. This one does not have the pulling method integrated.

## Usage
If you don't know what your saves are, you can run the script without flags.
### Saving one:
```bash
python3 save.py -n <SAVE_ID>
```
### Saving all:
```bash
python3 save.py -a
```
